# gpm-to-spotfy
This is a tool for exporting your Google Play Music library (albums and playlists) to Spotify.

To get some disclaimers out of the way: I created this project for personal use only in 2020. It may not work in the future (actually, with GPM shutting down, I can guarantee it won't). I have no plans to support any platforms other than Linux, so don't ask; if you want that, submit a pull request.

## Getting started
You'll need to install a few dependencies. On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ pip3 install gmusicapi
```
